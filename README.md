The client, "Artemis Financial" was a consulting company that developed individualized financial plans for their customers which included savings, retirement, investments and insurance. Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their operations which included upgrading their software security for their API. The task for myself was to complete a Vulnerability Assessment. 

A vulnerability assessment is used to find any potential security risks in the code provided. I feel that when running the assessment, I provided the client with a great mitigation plan that would help them update/patch their software to help it be more secure. Coding securely is very important when it comes to any project, but especially when a client's data is at risk. Lack of safe coding can lead to data breaches and cause the client to lose sensitive information. Cyber security is an important role in any major company. It can be beneficial to have a team on site compared to contracting because they will know the program and be there at any time there is a potential threat. 

The vulnerability assessment was fairly straightforward until we got to the false-positive section further into the class. I was stuck on identifying a false-positive for a bit and had to google many examples until I could wrap my head around it. 

To increase layers of security, I made sure that the code was clean and no errors were made, and would make sure to run every library at the latest version. I think the Dependency Check via OWASP was a great tool for assessing vulnerabilities and I would keep this in mind when needing to do assess vulnerabilities in the future. 

I did test the code many times to make sure it would function after editing and refactoring it. I also ran a dependency check before and after editing the code to make sure no new vulnerabilities were added. 

For resources, other than the dependency check, I used stackoverflow as a reference many times. I find that there is tons of information that can be helpful via that website and I will be using it in the future. 

If an employer asked for anything from this assignment, I would gladly show them the dependency check and the table where I broke down each vulnerability with a description of the potential threats with a potential solution to each problem.
